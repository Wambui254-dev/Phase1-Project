# Phase1-Project_
# Risk Analysis in Aviation

## Overview
As our company expands into the aviation industry, it is crucial to assess potential risks associated with different aircraft models. This project aims to analyze aircraft safety, operational costs, and reliability to determine the lowest-risk options for our new aviation division. The findings will provide actionable insights to guide purchasing decisions.

## Business Problem
Our company is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises without any knowledge about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are at the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation divison can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

## Objectives
- Analyze safety records and incident reports of various aircraft.
- Identify key risk factors and trends in aircraft safety.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for aircraft selection.

## Data Sources
The analysis will be based on **Kaggle Aviation Accident Database** . The Dataset "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses" is the aviation accident data set from 1962 to 2023 which I'll use in this project

## Data Cleaning Process
To ensure high-quality and accurate analysis, these are the following steps I will take to clean the Kaggle aviation accident dataset:
1. **Handle Missing Data**: Identify and fill or remove missing values in critical fields.
2. **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate redundant records that may skew the analysis.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather and clean relevant datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns and risk factors.
3. **Risk Assessment Modeling**: Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to assess aircraft risk.
4. **Visualization & Insights**: Present findings through interactive dashboards and reports.
5. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights to guide aircraft purchases.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau for visualization

## Deliverables
- A comprehensive risk assessment report
- Visual dashboards summarizing key insights
- A cleaned and structured aviation accident dataset

## Actionable Insights
- Identify aircraft with the **lowest accident rates**.

- Recommend **cost-effective and safe aircraft** for purchase.
- Offer insights into **common risk factors** affecting aviation safety.

## Conclusion
By leveraging data analytics, this project will help our company make informed decisions on aircraft purchases, ensuring safety and financial viability in the aviation sector.
